# Smartweave Explorer

A graphical interface for interacting with smartweave contracts

## Usage

- Open [Smartweave Explorer](https://acolytec3.github.io/smartweave-explorer)
- Load Wallet
- Prosper

## Features
- Load wallets from either JSON key files or BIP39 mnemonics
- Interact with any Smartweave contract using only the app 

## Additional thoughts
 - Your wallet **never ever** leaves your device.  That said, I make no guarantees about the security of your keys. It's the same as leaving your wallet key file lying around on your hard drive.
 - This app is mobile-first so it may look funky on desktop.  Forgive the whitespace
 - There are **no** fees applied through the use of this app. All transactions submitted through this app are pure Arweave transactions with no added fees. 
 - Trust but verify
 
 ## Roadmap
- [x] Split out from ArMob 2.0
- [] Abstract smartweave contract parsing into module
- [] Add parameter type inference
- [] Generate interface modules for any smartweave contract
